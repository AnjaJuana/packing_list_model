We have booked an apartment on each island for a few days and plan to spend most of our time relaxing. Our main goals are to enjoy the beach, try delicious local food, and possibly go on a hike—if it’s not too hot. We will be relying solely on public transport. We’re in our late 20s and traveling from the Netherlands.",
