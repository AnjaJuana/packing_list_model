# Working with Large Language Models
## Introduction
* What are LLMs and why are they popular
* How to use the open source platform to use LLMs for own application; example of creating a packing list.

## Why bother to adept models to your application
* Problems of LLMS: Hallucination and wrong outputs
* Controll outputs by using zero-shot-calssification
  * briefly mention other types of classification
* How we do it with our packing list model
  * Why not use packing items as classes
  * Use superclasses to categories trip and have packing items correspond to superclasses
  * Asses performance with small test data set
  * mention gradio app to make it user friendly and spaces to share model

## Implementation of packing list model
### Prerequisites before you start to code
* Hugging face account also use access token, mention api
* Use anaconda
* Install python and libraries 
* create jupyter notebook
* pip install stuff

### Predefine outputs/classes

### Model implementation

### Using gradio app

### Share your model
* created space
* created github access token on huffing face and then github actions workflow
* you need to install the required dependencies in the environment where your Hugging Face Space is running.
* create requirements.txt file with necessary libraries


## Performance assessment
* Test data creation

## Side notes
* Hugging face API (or mention during implementation)

## Closing
* Summary
* Limitations
